# Canto Identity Registration Guide

Welcome to the Canto Identity registration guide. This guide will walk you through the process of registering your Canto Identity (CID), a new protocol system designed to bring a broader, more meaningful interpretation to onchain self-expression.

## Understanding Canto Identity: CID

To create the most authentic reflection of onchain identity, a user would attach multiple subprotocol NFTs to their CID, to paint a more vivid picture of who they are. It is important to note that a wallet can only have one CID registered to its address at any given time.

At launch, CIP will have three subprotocol identity trait NFTs for users to attach to their CID:
- Canto Namespace
- PFP
- BIO

## Registering Your CID

To register a CID, users will need to:
1. Create a Canto Name
2. Have a Canto ERC721 NFT in their wallet
3. Write a bio to display to the community

Once you have all those prepared, follow the instructions below to register your CID.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Connecting your Wallet**
- Click on "Connect Wallet" in the top right-hand corner of the interface.
- If this is your first time connecting to Canto Identity, choose your preferred wallet option.
